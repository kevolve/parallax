# How it works
***

- The `header.html` file calls both the background image and the logo. 
- The `style.css` file makes the header full width, but keep a restricted area for your document content.

>Disclaimer: I'm not an html expert, and there is probably a better / cleaner solution to achieve that..


# Check the code

This minimal example is [from holtzy's github](https://github.com/holtzy/R-Markdown-Parallax). Have a look to it to see how it works.
